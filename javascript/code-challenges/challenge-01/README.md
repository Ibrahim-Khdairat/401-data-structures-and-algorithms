# Reverse an Array
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.
Example : 
  Input	     [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]              
 Output     	[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
