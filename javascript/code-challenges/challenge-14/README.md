## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

understood the problem first
I imagined how the results should be
I wrote the code
I made the tests
space : O(1)
time : O(n \* k)
after all it was taken almost 2 hour just to handel the whit bord .
